# shell-scripts
Solutions to a set of bash scripting exercises.  
* ex1.sh asks for a username, and echoes a message based on whether that username is currently logged in or not.  
* ex2.sh sets up a specified directory structure, creates a script which prints the working directory and then executes this script.  
* ex3.sh asks for a URL, curls the given URL, and echoes whether that curl received a response or not.  
* ex4.sh takes a filename, searches for the given file, and echoes a message stating whether the file is found and, if it is, the file path.  
* ex5.sh takes a filename and title, makes a directory with the name format month-year (if it does not exist), cds into that directory, creates a .md file with the given filename + day of the month, and writes to that file a header with the given title and date (format month/day/year).  
* calc.sh is a simple calculator which takes two numbers and an operation and echoes the result of that calculation.  
* sum.sh takes an array of numbers and echoes the sum of that array.  
* frac.sh is similar to calc.sh but performs fractional arithmetic on fractions entered as arrays in the format (numerator denominator).
